A fast-loading, casual web game where you move to dodge and tap/click to shoot, but the “fun pump” comes from reading enemy formations and choosing the right attack plan—not just spraying bullets. Each run is a series of compact “rooms” (or waves) culminating in a boss, with rare powerups that create memorable spikes without grind.
